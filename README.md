# 🎓 AI-Student-Dropout-Risk-Dashboard

An AI-powered Power BI dashboard to predict and visualize student dropout risk, enabling data-driven interventions in Nigerian schools.

---

## 📌 Project Overview


Student dropout is a persistent issue in the Nigerian education system, often caused by low parental engagement, irregular attendance, poor academic performance, and financial imbalance. This project aims to provide school administrators with a data-driven dashboard to:

Predict potential dropouts using key influencers.

Visualize student behavior across terms and classes.

Support decision-making to reduce student attrition.

Data was cleaned and merged in SQL, and analyzed using Power BI to design an interactive, AI-driven dashboard.

🎯 Objective
To develop an intelligent dashboard that helps educational institutions:

Identify at-risk students early.

Understand dropout patterns based on engagement, scores, and attendance.

Monitor term-wise performance metrics.

🔍 Insights from the Dashboard
Parental Engagement was the most significant factor influencing dropout risk.

Students with low attendance and below-average academic performance showed higher dropout tendencies.

Financial issues (unpaid balance) were strongly correlated with risk level.

Class levels with the highest risk concentration were identified to enable targeted intervention.
